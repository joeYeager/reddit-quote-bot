The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground.@Thomas Jefferson
Timid men prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of Liberty.@Thomas Jefferson
The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.@Thomas Jefferson

To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.
